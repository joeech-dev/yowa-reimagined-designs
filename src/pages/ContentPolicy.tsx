                 <li>Yowa Innovations (the "Photographer/Producer") is the author and first owner of copyright in all photographs, videos, films and related content created for a client, except where the law or a written contract expressly states otherwise.</li>
                 <li>Under the Uganda Copyright and Neighbouring Rights Act, 2006, copyright in commissioned or employed works can vest in the person who commissions or employs the creator, but only where this is clearly agreed or implied; in the absence of such an agreement, copyright remains with the author.</li>
                 <li>Unless a separate written agreement explicitly transfers copyright, all economic and moral rights in the work remain with Yowa Innovations, including the right to reproduce, distribute, adapt and publicly display the work.</li>
                 <li>Any transfer or assignment of copyright must be in a written, signed agreement that clearly specifies the scope, territory, duration and compensation of the transfer, in line with international copyright practice under the Berne framework.</li>

               <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 text-muted-foreground space-y-3">
                 <li>Upon full payment of all agreed fees, Yowa Innovations grants the client a non-exclusive, non-transferable licence to use the delivered content strictly for the purposes and in the media specified in the proposal, invoice or contract (for example: social media, website, internal presentations, specific campaigns or prints).</li>
                 <li>Any use outside the agreed scope (such as use by affiliates, resale to third parties, extended advertising campaigns, billboards, merchandise, TV or streaming broadcast) requires a separate written licence and may attract additional fees.</li>
                 <li>Unless expressly authorised in writing, the client may not grant sublicences or permit third parties (agencies, partners, sponsors, publishers) to use the content.</li>

               <ul className="list-disc pl-6 text-muted-foreground space-y-3">
                 <li>The client must not sell, redistribute, gift, or otherwise commercially exploit the content beyond the scope of the licence granted by Yowa Innovations.</li>
                 <li>High-resolution or original files (including RAW footage, uncompressed video and layered files) may not be shared publicly or with third parties without a binding written agreement that sets out scope, territory, duration and fees.</li>
                 <li>The client must not distort, mutilate or significantly alter the content (for example, heavy editing, cropping that removes credits, adding misleading elements) in a way that prejudices the Photographer's honour or reputation, in line with moral rights protections.</li>
                 <li>Use of the content in defamatory, illegal, hateful or otherwise unlawful contexts is strictly prohibited and will immediately terminate any licence granted.</li>

               <ul className="list-disc pl-6 text-muted-foreground space-y-3">
                 <li>Where reasonably practicable (e.g., websites, social media, digital campaigns), the client must credit the work as "© Yowa Innovations" or as otherwise agreed in writing.</li>
                 <li>Yowa Innovations retains the moral right to be identified as the author of the work and to object to derogatory treatment or distortion of the work, as recognised under Ugandan law.</li>
                 <li>The client is responsible for securing any necessary model releases, property releases or consents for the use of a person's image or property where the client controls the relationship with the subject (e.g., staff, talent, sponsored athletes), unless Yowa Innovations is specifically contracted to obtain such releases.</li>
                 <li>The client acknowledges that in Uganda, an individual's image rights (right to control commercial use of one's likeness) may limit how photographs or videos of that person can be exploited, even where copyright is owned by the Photographer; the client agrees to use the content only in ways consistent with the consents obtained from the subjects.</li>

                 Yowa Innovations retains the right to use the content for its own portfolio and promotional purposes, including on its website, social media, showreels, presentations and award submissions, unless the client and Yowa Innovations expressly agree in writing to restrict such use (for example, for confidential projects or embargoed campaigns).

               <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 text-muted-foreground space-y-3">
                 <li>Where Yowa Innovations creates content as an employee of another entity, or under a written agreement that explicitly states that copyright will vest in the employer or commissioning party, copyright will follow that agreement in accordance with the Uganda Copyright and Neighbouring Rights Act, 2006.</li>
                 <li>In all other cases, including typical client projects for photography and film production, copyright remains with Yowa Innovations and only a licence is granted.</li>

                 <li>Any unauthorised use, reproduction, alteration, distribution or sharing of the content beyond the licence granted will constitute copyright infringement under Ugandan law and applicable international standards.</li>
                 <li>In the event of infringement, Yowa Innovations may:
                   <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mt-2 space-y-2">
                     <li>Require immediate cessation of the infringing use and removal of the content from all channels.</li>
                     <li>Invoice the client for retroactive licence fees, penalties or damages (which may be higher than the original licence fee) in line with statutory remedies.</li>
                     <li>Pursue legal action or other appropriate remedies before competent courts or tribunals.</li>
                   </ul>

               <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 text-muted-foreground space-y-3">
                 <li>This policy is governed by the laws of Uganda, particularly the Copyright and Neighbouring Rights Act, 2006, and any subsequent amendments.</li>
                 <li>Because Uganda is a member of the Berne Union, the copyrighted works of Yowa Innovations may also benefit from protection in other countries that are parties to the Berne Convention and related international treaties.</li>
                 <li>Where content is used or exploited outside Uganda, the client agrees to comply with both this policy and any mandatory copyright rules in the countries where the content is used.</li>
