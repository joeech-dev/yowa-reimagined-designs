                 This Cookie Policy explains how we use cookies and similar tracking technologies on our website (the "Site"). By using the Site, you can choose which categories of cookies you allow, except for those that are strictly necessary for the Site to function.

               <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
                 Cookies are small text files that are stored on your device (computer, tablet or mobile) when you visit a website. They help websites recognise your device, remember your preferences and understand how you interact with pages and features.

               <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-4">We may use the following categories of cookies on the Site:</p>
               <ul className="list-disc pl-6 text-muted-foreground space-y-2">
                 <li><strong>Strictly necessary cookies</strong> – These cookies are essential for the operation of the Site, for example to enable page navigation, security features or access to secure areas. The Site cannot function properly without these cookies.</li>
                 <li><strong>Functional or preference cookies</strong> – These cookies remember choices you make (such as language, region or display settings) to provide a more personalised experience.</li>
                 <li><strong>Analytics/performance cookies</strong> – These cookies collect information about how visitors use the Site (for example, which pages are visited most often, and error messages) to help us improve performance and user experience, often using tools like Google Analytics.</li>
                 <li><strong>Marketing/advertising cookies</strong> – These cookies are used to deliver relevant advertisements, measure the effectiveness of marketing campaigns and help limit how often you see an ad.</li>
               </ul>
               <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mt-4">
                 We may use both session cookies (which expire when you close your browser) and persistent cookies (which remain on your device for a set period or until you delete them).

                 Some cookies on the Site may be placed by third-party service providers, such as analytics providers (e.g., Google Analytics) or advertising networks. These third parties may collect information about your online activities over time and across different websites, in accordance with their own privacy and cookie policies.

               <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-4">Depending on the cookie, the information collected may include:</p>

               <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
                 For strictly necessary cookies, our legal basis is our legitimate interest in operating and securing the Site. For all other cookie categories (functional, analytics, marketing), our legal basis is your consent, which you provide through our cookie banner or settings tool.

               <h2 className="font-display font-semibold text-2xl mb-4">7. How You Can Control Cookies</h2>
               <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-4">When you first visit the Site, you will see a cookie banner that allows you to:</p>
               <ul className="list-disc pl-6 text-muted-foreground space-y-2">
                 <li>Accept all cookies;</li>
                 <li>Reject non-essential cookies; or</li>
                 <li>Manage your preferences by category.</li>
               </ul>
               <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mt-4">
                 You can change your cookie preferences at any time by using the "Cookie Settings" link or tool available on the Site (for example, in the footer). In addition, you can control or delete cookies via your browser settings; most browsers allow you to block cookies, delete existing cookies or receive a warning before a cookie is stored. Please note that blocking some types of cookies may affect the functionality of the Site.

               <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
                 Some browsers offer a "Do Not Track" (DNT) signal. At present, there is no common industry standard for responding to DNT signals, and our Site may not respond to them. We will review and update our practices if a standard emerges.

               <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
                 Where cookie-related data is processed or stored outside your country (for example, on servers in the European Union, the United States or other jurisdictions), we take appropriate measures to ensure that such transfers comply with applicable data protection laws. This may include using standard contractual clauses or other approved safeguards where required by law.
